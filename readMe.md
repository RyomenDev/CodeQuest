## Project Description: Document Search Engine

## <u>Overview:</u>

The Document Search Engine is a web application designed to facilitate efficient searching and retrieval of information from a collection of documents. It utilizes various natural language processing techniques to preprocess the documents, extract keywords, calculate term frequencies, and generate relevant search results based on user queries.

## <u>Key Features:</u>

- <b><span style="font-size:larger;">Document Preprocessing:</span></b>

  - Removes stopwords and punctuation from the documents.
  - Tokenizes and normalizes the text to extract meaningful keywords.

- <b><span style="font-size:larger;">Keyword Generation:</span></b>

  - Generates a unique set of keywords from the document corpus.
  - Organizes keywords for efficient indexing and searching.

- <b><span style="font-size:larger;">Term Frequency Calculation:</span></b>

  - Calculates the term frequency (TF) of each keyword within each document.
  - Measures the frequency of occurrence of keywords to determine their significance.

- <b><span style="font-size:larger;">Inverse Document Frequency Calculation:</span></b>

  - Computes the inverse document frequency (IDF) of each keyword across the document corpus.
  - Determines the importance of keywords based on their rarity across documents.

- <b><span style="font-size:larger;">TF-IDF Vectorization:</span></b>

  - Combines TF and IDF to calculate the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vector for each document.
  - Represents documents as vectors to quantify their relevance to search queries.

- <b><span style="font-size:larger;">Search Engine Functionality:</span></b>
  - Processes user queries and matches them against the indexed documents. - Ranks search results based on TF-IDF similarity and other relevance metrics.
  - Provides relevant document snippets and links for user exploration.

## <u>Technologies Used:</u>

- <b><span style="font-size:larger;">Node.js and Express.js:</span></b> Backend framework for handling HTTP requests, routing, and server-side logic.

- <b><span style="font-size:larger;">JavaScript (ES6+):</span></b> Programming language for implementing server-side and client-side functionalities.

- <b><span style="font-size:larger;">Natural Language Processing (NLP) Libraries:</span></b>
  - stopword: Removes stopwords (common words) from documents.
  - remove-punctuation: Eliminates punctuation marks from text.
  - wink-lemmatizer: Lemmatizes words to their base form for better analysis.
  - number-to-words and words-to-numbers: Convert numbers to words and vice versa for enhanced query processing.
  - natural: Library for natural language processing tasks such as tokenization and lemmatization.
  - string-similarity: Computes string similarity metrics for search and matching purposes.
  - simple-spellchecker: Provides spell checking functionality for text processing tasks.

These dependencies enhance the capabilities of the Document Search Engine by providing additional functionality for text processing, spell checking, string similarity comparison, and validation tasks.

- <b><span style="font-size:larger;">Data Storage:</span></b>

  - File System (fs): Manages reading and writing documents and intermediate results.

- <b><span style="font-size:larger;">Web Development:</span></b>

  - Express EJS: Templating engine for rendering dynamic HTML content on the server side.
  - HTML5 and CSS3: Frontend markup and styling for the user interface.

- <b><span style="font-size:larger;">Dependency Management:</span></b>

  - npm (Node Package Manager): Manages project dependencies and scripts for development and production environments.

## <u>Workflow:</u>

- <b><span style="font-size:larger;">Document Processing:</span></b>

  - Documents are preprocessed to extract meaningful keywords and remove noise.
  - Preprocessing involves tokenization, stopword removal, punctuation removal, and lemmatization.

- <b><span style="font-size:larger;">Indexing:</span></b>

  - Keywords are indexed and stored for efficient retrieval during search operations.
  - Term frequencies (TF) and inverse document frequencies (IDF) are calculated and stored for each keyword.

- <b><span style="font-size:larger;">Search Operations:</span></b>

  - User queries are processed and matched against the indexed keywords.
  - Relevant documents are retrieved based on TF-IDF similarity and other ranking criteria.
  - Search results are presented to the user along with document snippets and links for further exploration.

- <b><span style="font-size:larger;">User Interface:</span></b>
  - The web application provides a user-friendly interface for querying and browsing documents.
  - Search results are displayed in a clear and organized manner, facilitating easy navigation and exploration.
